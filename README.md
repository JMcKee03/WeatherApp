# WeatherApp

A lightweight, browser-based weather application that displays real-time weather data based on user location. The app pulls live data from a third-party weather API and presents current conditions in a clean, easy-to-read interface designed for quick, practical use.

The application uses client-side JavaScript to fetch and process API data asynchronously, dynamically updating the UI without page reloads. It emphasizes clear formatting, responsive layout, and user-friendly presentation of weather details such as temperature and conditions.

This project is hosted using GitHub Pages and demonstrates core front-end development concepts including API integration, asynchronous data handling, and static site deployment.
